# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

my orchestra teacher often has problems getting some students to practise, practise some specific parts. this is due to him being unable to get in contact with them or they don't know what do due to being away


## End-User Requirements

my typical end-user will be either an orchestra student or teacher. it should be simple to use with a basic interface so that people of any age can use


## Proposed Solution
this website will have two different views, one for students and one for teachers. the students will allow them access any songs assigned to them by thier teacher on top of any notes provided. it will also allow them to join classes.

the teachers version will allow them to create classes, add students to the classes. in those classes the will be able add students to them, assign songs to the class and assign notes about them to the full class on top of assigning specific notes to specific students. when viewing the class they shpu;ld see student names and instrument they play

### Relevance to the System

i will be having a couple of end users, some older and some younger and will need to make sure no information can be accsessed by someone who isnt meant to, espicially if its associated with schools.

i will need to consider making sure that there is no way to accsess databases. this includes scrubbing any html out of usernames and hashing passwords

all websites need to function to be used and all websites need to be done well to be used by the public and any kind of end-user.

the end-user is the person whos going to be using my website and is the most important person to consider.

### Relevance to the System

since the end-user is the person who will be using the website i will need to consider things like what my typical end user is, what kind of technical skills they have and what they are actully using this for.
