# Sprint 1 - A Working UI Prototype


## Sprint Goals

Develop a prototype that simulates the key functionality of the system, then test and refine it so that it can serve as the model for the next phase of development in Sprint 2.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is used to develop the prototype.

## Initial Database Design

a three part connected data base with the users, music peices and who they're assigned to

### Required Data Input

end users will be required to provide thier instrument upon account creation. when teachers add a song they will be required to provide a song name and any specifics about the song they want aswell 

this will be done through various forms

### Required Data Output

for the teachers
- a list of classes
- a list of students in said class, displayed with their name and instrument
- a list of songs assigned to the class

for the student
- a list of classes they are in
- a list of songs assigned to thier classes
- any notes or specifications for the song


### Required Data Processing

- classes must be filtered to only display to who is in them 
- songs must be filtered to only show in classes they are assigned to

## UI 'Flow'

The first stage of prototyping was to explore how the UI might 'flow' between states, based on the required functionality.

This Figma demo shows the initial design for the UI 'flow':

**FIGMA FLOW - PLACE THE FIGMA EMBED CODE HERE - MAKE SURE IT IS SET SO THAT EVERYONE CAN ACCESS IT**

### Testing

Replace this text with notes about what you did to test the UI flow and the outcome of the testing.

### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

## Initial UI Prototype

The next stage of prototyping was to develop the layout for each screen of the UI.

This Figma demo shows the initial layout design for the UI:

### Testing

Replace this text with notes about what you did to test the UI flow and the outcome of the testing.

### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

*FIGMA IMPROVED PROTOTYPE - PLACE THE FIGMA EMBED CODE HERE - MAKE SURE IT IS SET SO THAT EVERYONE CAN ACCESS IT*

## Refined UI Prototype

Having established the layout of the UI screens, the prototype was refined visually, in terms of colour, fonts, etc.

This Figma demo shows the UI with refinements applied:

*FIGMA REFINED PROTOTYPE - PLACE THE FIGMA EMBED CODE HERE - MAKE SURE IT IS SET SO THAT EVERYONE CAN ACCESS IT*

### Testing

Replace this text with notes about what you did to test the UI flow and the outcome of the testing.

### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

## Sprint Review

Replace this text with a statement about how the sprint has moved the project forward - key success point, any things that didn't go so well, etc.
